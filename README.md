## Introduction 

ðŸ’– This repository provides an inference toolkit for structured table recognition in documents. The table structure is recognized using a self-trained model. The related code is a secondary development based on [TableStructureRec](https://github.com/RapidAI/TableStructureRec/tree/main).

## Installation
```python {linenos=table}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
We provide a simple script that can be used directly. With a single command, it outputs results in three formats: HTML, JSON, and intermediate visualizations.
```
python inference_batch.py --input_folder test_image
```

## Public Datasets
We have curated several public table training datasets, including **TAL_table**, **iflytab**, and **wtw**. We would like to thank the organizations for opening these datasets. In the future, we will also release our private dataset.

```

## Future Work
- Integrate our latest self-developed dewarping and text rectification models  
- Improve model performance on complex borderless tables  
- Release training scripts and datasets
